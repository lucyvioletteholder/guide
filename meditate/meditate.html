        Meditation and its connection to wellbeing <br><br>
        Past research has shown that mindfulness meditation is useful for the
        attenuation of psychological and physical suffering in clinical populations. In
        structured mindfulness-based interventions, patients engage in meditation exercises
        to refine their attentional skills and to learn to purposefully relate to the present
        moment experience in a non-judgemental manner. Following the development of
        such interventions, mindfulness has also received considerable attention in
        academic psychology, where it has been incorporated in the self-determination
        theory (SDT). According to SDT, the cultivation of mindfulness may warrant
        effective need gratification and consequently yield enhanced well-being in healthy
        individuals. In this context, in the current study, we examined the association
        between mindfulness meditation, self-reported trait mindfulness and their
        predictive value for psychological well-being in a non-clinical sample. Individuals
        who engaged in mindfulness meditation regularly (N = 30) were compared to
        individuals without meditation experience (N = 30) on various scales which
        assessed trait mindfulness and psychological well-being. Meditators reported
        higher emotional well-being, which was predicted by frequency and duration of
        practice. Especially those practitioners, who made efforts to implement
        mindfulness practice in activities of everyday life showed enhanced emotional
        adjustment. In an explorative analysis, mindfulness was identified as a putative
        partial mediator of the relationship between meditation practice and well-being.
        Despite methodological constraints, results of the current study suggest that
        mindfulness meditation, in a non-clinical context, is associated with increased
        psychological well-being, and as such worth to be explored in more detail by
        future research. The study and its results might be relevant for the clinical sector as
        well, since they provide some information on how individuals with e.g., subclinical
        residual symptoms can protect themselves complementarily to CBT, but without
        participating in a completely structured mindfulness-based intervention.
        Summarizing one may say that individuals who engage in meditation exercises
        report higher emotional well-being. Well-being appears to increase especially for
        those practitioners who practice more frequently and with longer session duration.
        Mindfulness could be a candidate for a putative mediator of this relationship
        between increased well-being and meditation practice. Especially those meditators
        who report to make efforts to be mindful and hence transport their meditation
        practice into everyday life might derive benefits concerning their emotional wellbeing.
        Meditation, in a non-clinical context, may be a basis for increased
        psychological well-being.
