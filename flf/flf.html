                Ficus Lyrata. <br><br>
                Origin: West Africa <br><br>
                The fiddle-leaf fig (Ficus lyrata) is a popular indoor specimen
                plant featuring very large, heavily veined, violin-shaped leaves
                that grow upright. These plants are native to tropical parts of
                Africa, where they thrive in very warm and wet conditions. This
                makes them somewhat challenging for the home grower, who is
                likely to have trouble duplicating these steamy conditions.
                However, they are relatively tough plants that can withstand
                a less-than-perfect environment for a fairly long time.
                Fiddle-leaf figs are perfect as focal points of a room if you
                can situate them in a floor-standing container where the plant
                is allowed to grow to at least 6 feet. (Most indoor specimens r
                each around 10 feet tall.) They’re fairly fast growers and can
                be potted at any point in the year if you're like most gardener
                s acquiring a nursery plant to keep indoors.<br><br>
                Light:<br>
                Fiddle-leaf figs require bright, filtered light to grow and
                look their best. Direct sunlight can burn the leaves, especially
                exposure to hot afternoon sun.1 And plants that are kept in
                very low light conditions will fail to grow rapidly.<br><br>
                Water:<br>
                Fiddle-leaf figs like a moderate amount of moisture in the
                soil. If the plant doesn’t get enough water, its leaves will
                wilt and lose their bright green color. And if it gets too much
                water, the plant might drop its leaves and suffer from root rot,
                which ultimately can kill it. During the growing season (spring
                to autumn), water your fiddle-leaf fig when the top inch of soil
                feels dry. And over the winter months, water slightly less.
                Furthermore, these plants are sensitive to high salt levels in
                the soil. So it's ideal to flush the soil until water comes out
                the bottom of the pot at least monthly. This helps to prevent
                salt build-up.<br><br>
                Humidity:<br>
                Fiddle-leaf figs don’t like extreme temperature fluctuations.
                A room that’s between 60 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit is typically
                fine, though you must position the plant away from drafty
                areas, as well as air-conditioning and heating vents. These can
                cause sudden temperature shifts. Aim for a humidity level
                between 30% and 65%. If you need to supplement humidity,
                mist your plant with clean water in a spray bottle daily. Or
                you can place it on a tray of pebbles filled with water, as
                long as the bottom of the pot isn’t touching the water. Plus,
                fiddle-leaf figs can benefit from being in a room with a
                humidifier.<br>
