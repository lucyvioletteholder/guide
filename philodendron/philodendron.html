          Philodendron Hederaceum. <br><br>
          Origin: South America <br><br>
          There are over 400 different species of philodendrons, covering a
          variety of growing methods, leaf shapes, and care requirements.
          The common dark green Heartleaf Philodendron is a beginner friendly, easy
          to maintain indoor houseplant. Heart-shaped, glossy leaves emerge
          bronze, then quickly turn green. The leaves are typically 2-4 in
          (5-10 cm) long, and cover its long, slender stems that can grow to 4
          ft (1.2 m) or more. Philodendron hederaceum will thrive in a small
          pot for a couple years with little care. Despite its tropical origins,
          this beautiful evergreen plant is tolerant of dry air, although it
          appreciates occasional misting. Keep its leaves clean by wiping
          them with a damp cloth. <br><br>
          Light:<br>
          Moderate to bright light. Small leaves or long spaces between
          leaves show that the plant is not getting enough light. Move heartleaf
          philodendron plant to a brighter location, but not into direct sun which
          can scorch its leaves. It thrives under fluorescent light, too, making
          it an ideal office plant.<br><br>
          Water: <br> Keep soil lightly moist spring through fall. Allow surface
          to dry out between waterings in winter. Yellow leaves are caused by
          overwatering. Always use tepid water for your houseplants because
          cold water is a shock to these tropical natives.<br><br>
          Humidity: <br>Tolerant of dry air, but likes humidity.
          Try to maintain 40% relative humidity or higher.Brown leaf
          tips are a symptom of dry air.
