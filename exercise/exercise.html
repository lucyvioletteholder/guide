    Exercise and the brain  <br><br>

    Many evidences demonstrated that physical exercise (PE) affects brain
    plasticity, influencing cognition and wellbeing (Weinberg and Gould,
    2015; for review see Fernandes et al., 2017). In fact, experimental
    and clinical studies have reported that PE induces structural and functional
    changes in the brain, determining enormous biological, and psychological benefits.

    In general, when reported PE effects, it is customary to separate the
    biological aspects from the psychological ones. In fact, most of the
    studies documented either the effects of PE on the brain (and then on the
    cognitive functioning) or on the wellbeing (in terms of physical and mental
    health). In this review, we merge both these aspects as they influence each
    other. In fact, behaviorally appropriate choices depend upon efficient
    cognitive functioning. Furthermore, emotional states influence cognitive
    functions through specific cerebral circuitry involving prefrontal areas
    and limbic structures (Barbas, 2000).

    Before analyzing the benefits of PE, it is necessary to define PE precisely.
    Indeed, PE is a term often incorrectly used interchangeably with physical
    activity (PA) that is “any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles
    that requires energy expenditure” (World Health Organization, 2010). Then,
    PA includes any motor behavior such as daily and leisure activities and it
    is considered a determinant lifestyle for general health status (Burkhalter
    and Hillman, 2011). Instead, PE is “a sub classification of PA that is planned,
    structured, repetitive, and has as a final or an intermediate objective the
    improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness”
    (World Health Organization, 2010). Examples of PE are aerobic and anaerobic
    activity, characterized by a precise frequency, duration and intensity.

    In this review, we illustrate the biological and psychological benefits of
    PE on cognition and wellbeing both in health and diseases, reporting data
    from both animal and human studies. The biological basis at both molecular
    and supramolecular level have been largely studied. The other aim of present
    work is to report the actual evidence on the epigenetic mechanisms that
    determine or modulate the biological effects of PE on the brain. In fact,
    while the biologic mechanisms are sufficiently studied both at the molecular
    and supramolecular levels (see Lista and Sorrentino, 2010), little is known
    about the epigenetic ones. Finally, the modality with which PE should be
    practiced to gain such advantages while avoiding negative consequences will
    be discussed. In Table 1 are reported the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    for studies discussed in this review.
