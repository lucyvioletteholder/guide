      Oceanside living and its connection to wellbeing <br><br> 


      Over the last several years, an increasing number of studies have been
      devoted to discovering the effects that nature, physical activity, or the
       combination of both have on an individualâ€™s psychological well-being.
       Much of the current research was conducted
outside of the United States in countries such as England, Australia, and New Zealand by
analyzing
secondary data from cross sectional surveys. Many of the participants were asked to self-report
feelings of depression, anxiety, and general mood, as well as quantify interactions with nature,
and habits of physical activity in addition to a multitude of demographic and other general
questions. The findings of current research are mostly congruent with previous research,
however due to the limited sample sizes, are not generalizable a larger population. The limited
sample sizes refer to specific populations such as veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress
disorder, or individuals who only live within a certain proximity to blue/green space. Topics
addressed in this review are psychological well-being, nature (blue and green spaces) and
physical activity.       <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/db7a28ffa2d22638ed0c1789e1c2e4a1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=51922&diss=y">
